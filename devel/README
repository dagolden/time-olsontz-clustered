# README FOR GENERATING OLSON CLUSTERS

## How to generate a cluster file:

The 'olson.pl' program generates cluster and reverse map data structures in
Data::Dumper format for manual update.

  $ perl olson.pl

In the future, it should be amended to try to preserve ordering information.
E.g. if America/Chicago is the primary for the Central Time cluster, we'd like
to try to keep that and the description the same.

## How to curate the cluster file:

Review all countries with clusters with multiple zones.  Move the most
significant zone to the beginning of the array.  Change the cluster
description to represent the entire cluster.

Review all multi-cluster countries, even if they have a single zone
per cluster.  See if the descriptions can be updated in a useful way.

### Notes on manual adjustments:

As of January, 2013:

- America/Argentina/San_Luis time zone is broken; I manually grouped it with
  the rest of Argentina and set its offset accordingly.

- Africa/Egypt time zone is broken; I manually set its offset to +2

## How to convert cluster file to Sereal encoded version

Run 'dd2slr.pl' on each .dd file to generate equivalent .srl files.
Copy those into the main share directory.
